I was a member of the team formed by The Chinese University of Hong Kong to attend ["Digital and E-sports Invitational"](https://aiarena.tencent.com/aiarena/en/match/fisu). We were given the gpu resources and 
game simulation environment to design and imporve character's strategy with Reinforcement Learning algorithm. The training architecture is based on PPO algorithm and we utilized lstm and self-attention mechanism to store long-term information and handle shared knowledge. We got 6th place in the final round.
