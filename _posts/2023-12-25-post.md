The rendering competition is carried by [CGL](https://cgl.ethz.ch/) lab. Each pariticipate is supposed to implement several 
rendering features by [nori](https://cgl.ethz.ch/teaching/cg23/www-nori/index.html), an educational ray tracer. Final rendered image 
can be viewed inside the post by clicking the title. Particularly, I implemented the following features:
  - Images as Textures and Normal Mapping 
  - Wind-sinc reconstruction filters  
  - Mip-Mapping for Textures 
  - Heterogeneous Volumetric Participating Media 
  - Anisotropic Phase Function (Henyey-Greenstein)
