Education
======
* M.S. in ETH Zurich, 2023 - 2025(expected)
* B.S. in The Chinese University of Hong Kong 2018 - 2023

Experience
======
* Mar 2022:  LVS-Net: Line Voting with Segmentation for Visual Localization
  * Supervised by teaching assistent RÂ´emi Pautrat in ETH, I worked with other three team members to
    estimate camera pose from 2D-3D correspondences that are gained from extended VS-Net.
  * The project involves the preprocessing of data and network training. In contrast to the traditional
    network-based visual localization which utilizes point 2D-3D correspondence, our model outputs line
    correspondence to provide more spatial information for RANSAC-Pnp algorithm.

* Sep 2021:  3D Human Pose Reconstruction from Monocular Image
  * In the final year thesis on 3D human pose reconstruction, we refer to a model called I2L-MeshNet and
    try to improve it with other new network blocks. Human3.6M was used as our training dataset.
  * The graph convolutional network is adapted to substitute the original convolutional layers to exploit
    human skeleton structure information. Besides, we utilized other training strategies such as weakly
    supervised learning
